# A17 Time Zones Screen Saver

v.1.0.23

Displays <a href="https://time.area17.com/" target="blank">time.area17.com</a> within a macOS screen saver. Passes controllable parameters to control the display of clock type, clock format, temperature units and display of temperature and weather; more info on these parameters in the [time repository](https://github.com/area17/time).

Download the screen saver here: [A17TimeZones.saver.zip](https://time.area17.com/downloads/A17TimeZones.saver.zip)

## Installing

I'm not a certified developer and so installing the screen saver might not be as simple as double-clicking it. Instead you may have to right click/control click and select "open" and then select "open" on the prompt.

As this was built by a FE developer its likely to be a bit rough around the edges, any pointers would be appreciated.
